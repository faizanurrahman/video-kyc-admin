# CEDA Loan Management Application

Berif Description: The Loan Application Management System is a web-based application developed for a Botswana client to manage their loan application process. The system allows customers to register, login, and manage their loan applications. Upon logging in, customers are presented with a dashboard that displays their active loans and corresponding payments. They can also view their activity history and download their loan application review as a portable document.

Customers can apply for a new loan and resume any previously saved application with all data populated. The loan application status can range from pending to submitted, and the customers can review their submitted or rejected applications. The system also provides features for changing and resetting passwords.

To ensure smooth and efficient management of the loan application process, the system incorporates state management using the NgRx library. This enables centralized storage and management of the application state, ensuring consistency and preventing issues such as state mutations and inconsistent UI behavior.

Detailed Description:
The Citizen Entrepreneurial Development Agency (CEDA) is a government agency in Botswana that provides financial assistance and support to entrepreneurs and small business owners. To better serve our customers and make it easier for them to access financial assistance, we are developing a new loan management application.

The CEDA Loan Management Application is a user-friendly, mobile-first platform that allows users to apply for loans, manage their loan payments, and receive notifications about loan-related information. This application provides users with a variety of loan options to suit their needs, and also offers attractive loan packages and special offers to encourage them to take out loans.

With the CEDA Loan Management Application, users can easily submit loan applications, which are reviewed and approved by our team of financial experts. Users can track their loan application status and receive notifications about the approval process. Once the loan is approved, users can manage their loan payments, view their payment history, and receive reminders about upcoming payments.

The application also offers a range of loan options to choose from, including short-term and long-term loans, revolving credit facilities, and asset financing. The loan packages are designed to provide users with flexible repayment terms and attractive interest rates, making it easier for them to repay their loans.

To encourage users to take out loans, the application also offers various promotional offers and incentives. These can include reduced interest rates, waived fees, and other special benefits that users can take advantage of when they apply for a loan through the application.

Overall, the CEDA Loan Management Application is designed to make it easy and convenient for users to apply for and manage their loans. With its user-friendly interface, flexible loan packages, and attractive promotional offers, we believe it will be a valuable tool for our customers, helping them to achieve their financial goals and grow their businesses.
